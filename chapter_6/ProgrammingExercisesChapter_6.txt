                         PROGRAMMING EXERCISES CHAPTER 6


1.  Write a program that reads keyboard input to the @ symbol and that echoes
    the input except for digits, converting each uppercase character to
    lowercase, and vice versa. (Don’t forget the cctype family.)

2.  Write a program that reads up to 10 donation values into an array of double.
    (Or, if you prefer, use an array template object.) The program should
    terminate input on non-numeric input. It should report the average of the
    numbers and also report how many numbers in the array are larger than the
    average.

3.  Write a precursor to a menu-driven program.The program should display a menu
    offering four choices, each labeled with a letter. If the user responds with
    a letter other than one of the four valid choices, the program should prompt
    the user to enter a valid response until the user complies. Then the program
    should use a switch to select a simple action based on the user’s selection.
    A program run could look something like this:

    Please enter one of the following choices:
    c) carnivore p) pianist
    t) tree g) game
    f
    Please enter a c, p, t, or g: q
    Please enter a c, p, t, or g: t
    A maple is a tree.

4.  When you join the Benevolent Order of Programmers, you can be known at BOP
    meetings by your real name, your job title, or your secret BOP name. Write a
    program that can list members by real name, by job title, by secret name, or
    by a member’s preference. Base the program on the following structure:

    // Benevolent Order of Programmers name structure
    struct bop {
        char fullname[strsize]; // real name
        char title[strsize]; // job title
        char bopname[strsize]; // secret BOP name
        int preference; // 0 = fullname, 1 = title, 2 = bopname
    };

    In the program, create a small array of such structures and initialize it to
    suitable values. Have the program run a loop that lets the user select from
    different alternatives:

    a. display by name b. display by title
    c. display by bopname d. display by preference
    q. quit

    Note that “display by preference” does not mean display the
    preferencemember; it means display the member corresponding to the
    preference number. For instance, if preference is 1, choice d would display
    the programmer’s job title. A sample run may look something like the
    following:

    Benevolent Order of Programmers Report
    a. display by name b. display by title
    c. display by bopname d. display by preference
    q. quit
    Enter your choice: a
    Wimp Macho
    Raki Rhodes
    Celia Laiter
    Hoppy Hipman
    Pat Hand
    Next choice: d
    Wimp Macho
    Junior Programmer
    MIPS
    Analyst Trainee
    LOOPY
    Next choice: q
    Bye!

5.  The Kingdom of Neutronia, where the unit of currency is the tvarp, has the
    following income tax code:

    First 5,000 tvarps: 0% tax
    Next 10,000 tvarps: 10% tax
    Next 20,000 tvarps: 15% tax
    Tvarps after 35,000: 20% tax

    For example, someone earning 38,000 tvarps would owe 5,000 × 0.00 + 10,000 ×
    0.10 + 20,000 × 0.15 + 3,000 × 0.20, or 4,600 tvarps.Write a program that
    uses a loop to solicit incomes and to report tax owed.The loop should
    terminate when the user enters a negative number or non-numeric input.

6.  Put together a program that keeps track of monetary contributions to the
    Society for the Preservation of Rightful Influence. It should ask the user
    to enter the number of contributors and then solicit the user to enter the
    name and contribution of each contributor. The information should be stored
    in a dynamically allocated array of structures. Each structure should have
    two members: a character array (or else a string object) to store the name
    and a double member to hold the amount of the contribution. After reading
    all the data, the program should display the names and amounts donated for
    all donors who contributed $10,000 or more. This list should be headed by
    the label Grand Patrons.After that, the program should list the remaining
    donors. That list should be headed Patrons. If there are no donors in one
    of the categories, the program should print the word “none.” Aside from
    displaying two categories, the program need do no sorting.

7.  Write a program that reads input a word at a time until a lone q is entered.
    The program should then report the number of words that began with vowels,
    the number that began with consonants, and the number that fit neither of
    those categories. One approach is to use isalpha() to discriminate between
    words beginning with letters and those that don’t and then use an if or
    switch statement to further identify those passing the isalpha() test that
    begin with vowels. A sample run might look like this:

    Enter words (q to quit):
    The 12 awesome oxen ambled
    quietly across 15 meters of lawn. q
    5 words beginning with vowels
    4 words beginning with consonants
    2 others

8.  Write a program that opens a text file, reads it character-by-character to
    the end of the file, and reports the number of characters in the file.

9.  Do Programming Exercise 6 but modify it to get information from a file. The
    first item in the file should be the number of contributors, and the rest of
    the file should consist of pairs of lines, with the first line of each pair
    being a contributor’s name and the second line being a contribution. That
    is, the file should look like this:

    4
    Sam Stone
    2000
    Freida Flass
    100500
    Tammy Tubbs
    5000
    Rich Raptor
    55000
