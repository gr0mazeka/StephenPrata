                         PROGRAMMING EXERCISES CHAPTER 12


1.  Consider the following class declaration:

    class Cow {
        char name[20];
        char * hobby;
        double weight;
    public:
        Cow();
        Cow(const char * nm, const char * ho, double wt);
        Cow(const Cow c&);
        ~Cow();
        Cow & operator=(const Cow & c);
        void ShowCow() const; // display all cow data
    };

    Provide the implementation for this class and write a short program that
    uses all the member functions.

2.  Enhance the String class declaration (that is, upgrade string1.h to
    string2.h) by doing the following:

    a. Overload the + operator to allow you to join two strings into one.
    b. Provide a stringlow() member function that converts all alphabetic
       characters in a string to lowercase. (Don’t forget the cctype family of
       character functions.)
    c. Provide a stringup() member function that converts all alphabetic
       characters in a string to uppercase.
    d. Provide a member function that takes a char argument and returns the
       number of times the character appears in the string.

    Test your work in the following program:

    // pe12_2.cpp
    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;
    #include "string2.h"
    int main()
    {
        String s1(" and I am a C++ student.");
        String s2 = "Please enter your name: ";
        String s3;
        cout << s2; // overloaded << operator
        cin >> s3; // overloaded >> operator
        s2 = "My name is " + s3; // overloaded =, + operators
        cout << s2 << ".\n";
        s2 = s2 + s1;
        s2.stringup(); // converts string to uppercase
        cout << "The string\n" << s2 << "\ncontains " << s2.has('A')
        << " 'A' characters in it.\n";
        s1 = "red"; // String(const char *),
        // then String & operator=(const String&)
        String rgb[3] = { String(s1), String("green"), String("blue") };
        cout << "Enter the name of a primary color for mixing light: ";
        String ans;
        bool success = false;
        while (cin >> ans)
        {
            ans.stringlow(); // converts string to lowercase
            for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
            {
                if (ans == rgb[i]) // overloaded == operator
                {
                    cout << "That's right!\n";
                    success = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (success)
                break;
            else
                cout << "Try again!\n";
        }
        cout << "Bye\n";
        return 0;
    }

    Your output should look like this sample run:

    Please enter your name: Fretta Farbo
    My name is Fretta Farbo.
    The string
    MY NAME IS FRETTA FARBO AND I AM A C++ STUDENT.
    contains 6 'A' characters in it.
    Enter the name of a primary color for mixing light: yellow
    Try again!
    BLUE
    That's right!
    Bye

3.  Rewrite the Stock class,as described in Listings 10.7 and 10.8 in Chapter 10
    so that it uses dynamically allocated memory directly instead of using
    string class objects to hold the stock names. Also replace the show() member
    function with an overloaded operator<<() definition. Test the new definition
    program in Listing 10.9.

4.  Consider the following variation of the Stack class defined in
    Listing 10.10:

    // stack.h -- class declaration for the stack ADT
    typedef unsigned long Item;
    class Stack
    {
    private:
        enum {MAX = 10}; // constant specific to class
        Item * pitems; // holds stack items
        int size; // number of elements in stack
        int top; // index for top stack item
    public:
        Stack(int n = MAX); // creates stack with n elements
        Stack(const Stack & st);
        ~Stack();
        bool isempty() const;
        bool isfull() const;
        // push() returns false if stack already is full, true otherwise
        bool push(const Item & item); // add item to stack
        // pop() returns false if stack already is empty, true otherwise
        bool pop(Item & item); // pop top into item
        Stack & operator=(const Stack & st);
    };

    As the private members suggest,this class uses a dynamically allocated array
    to hold the stack items. Rewrite the methods to fit this new representation
    and write a program that demonstrates all the methods, including the copy
    constructor and assignment operator.

5.  The Bank of Heather has performed a study showing that ATM customers won't
    wait more than one minute in line. Using the simulation from Listing 12.10,
    find a value for number of customers per hour that leads to an average wait
    time of one minute.(Use at least a 100-hour trial period.)

6.  The Bank of Heather would like to know what would happen if it added a
    second ATM. Modify the simulation in this chapter so that it has two queues.
    Assume that a customer will join the first queue if it has fewer people in
    it than the second queue and that the customer will join the second queue
    otherwise. Again, find a value for number of customers per hour that leads
    to an average wait time of one minute. (Note: This is a nonlinear problem in
    that doubling the number of ATMs doesn’t double the number of customers who
    can be handled per hour with a one-minute wait maximum.)
