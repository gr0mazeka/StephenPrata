                         PROGRAMMING EXERCISES CHAPTER 10


1.  Provide method definetions for the class described in Chapter Review
    Question 5 and write a short program that illustrates all the features.

2.  Here is a rather simple class definition:

    class Person {
        private:
        static const LIMIT = 25;
        string lname; // Person’s last name
        char fname[LIMIT]; // Person’s first name
        public:
        Person() {lname = ""; fname[0] = ‘\0’; } // #1
        Person(const string & ln, const char * fn = "Heyyou"); // #2
        // the following methods display lname and fname
        void Show() const; // firstname lastname format
        void FormalShow() const; // lastname, firstname format
    };

    (It uses both a string object and a character array so that you can compare
    how the two forms are used.) Write a program that completes the
    implementation by providing code for the undefined methods. The program in
    which you use the class should also use the three possible constructor calls
    (no arguments,one argument, and two arguments) and the two display methods.
    Here’s an example that uses the constructors and methods:

    Person one; // use default constructor
    Person two("Smythecraft"); // use #2 with one default argument
    Person three("Dimwiddy", "Sam"); // use #2, no defaults
    one.Show();
    cout << endl;
    one.FormalShow();
    // etc. for two and three

3.  Do Programming Exercise 1 from Chapter 9 but replace the code shown there
    with an appropriate golf class declaration. Replace setgolf(golf &, const
    char*, int) with a constructor with the appropriate argument for providing
    initial values. Retain the interactive version of setgolf() but implement it
    by using the constructor. (For example,for the code for setgolf(), obtain
    the data,pass the data to the constructor to create a temporary object, and
    assign the temporary object to the invoking object, which is *this.)

4.  Do Programming Exercise 4 from Chapter 9 but convert the Sales structure and
    its associated functions to a class and its methods. Replace the
    setSales(Sales &, double[], int) function with a constructor. Implement the
    interactive setSales(Sales &) method by using the constructor. Keep the
    class within the namespace SALES.

5.  Consider the following structure declaration:

    struct customer {
        char fullname[35];
        double payment;
    };

    Write a program that adds and removes customer structures from a stack,
    represented by a Stack class declaration. Each time a customer is removed,
    his or her payment should be added to a running total, and the running total
    should be reported. Note: You should be able to use the Stack class
    unaltered; just change the typedef declaration so that Item is type customer
    instead of unsigned long.

6.  Here’s a class declaration:

    class Move
    {
    private:
        double x;
        double y;
    public:
        Move(double a = 0, double b = 0); // sets x, y to a, b
        showmove() const; // shows current x, y values
        Move add(const Move & m) const;
    // this function adds x of m to x of invoking object to get new x,
    // adds y of m to y of invoking object to get new y, creates a new
    // move object initialized to new x, y values and returns it
        reset(double a = 0, double b = 0); // resets x, y to a, b
    };

    Create member function definitions and a program that exercises the class.

7.  A Betelgeusean plorg has these properties:

    Data
        A plorg has a name with no more than 19 letters.
        A plorg has a contentment index (CI), which is an integer.
    Operations
        A new plorg starts out with a name and a CI of 50.
        A plorg’s CI can change.
        A plorg can report its name and CI.
        The default plorg has the name "Plorga" .

    Write a Plorg class declaration (including data members and member function
    prototypes) that represents a plorg.Write the function definitions for the
    member functions. Write a short program that demonstrates all the features
    of the Plorg class.

8.  You can describe a simple list as follows:

    - The simple list can hold zero or more items of some particular type.
    - You can create an empty list.
    - You can add items to the list.
    - You can determine whether the list is empty.
    - You can determine whether the list is full.
    - You can visit each item in the list and perform some action on it.

    As you can see, this list really is simple; it doesn’t allow insertion or
    deletion, for example.

    Design a List class to represent this abstract type. You should provide a
    list.h header file with the class declaration and a list.cpp file with the
    class method implementations. You should also create a short program that
    utilizes your design.

    The main reason for keeping the list specification simple is to simplify
    this programming exercise. You can implement the list as an array or, if
    you’re familiar with the data type, as a linked list. But the public
    interface should not depend on your choice. That is, the public interface
    should not have array indices,pointers to nodes, and so on. It should be
    expressed in the general concepts of creating a list, adding an item to the
    list, and so on. The usual way to handle visiting each item and performing
    an action is to use a function that takes a function pointer as an argument:

        void visit(void (*pf)(Item &));

    Here pf points to a function (not a member function) that takes a reference
    to Item argument, where Item is the type for items in the list. The visit()
    function applies this function to each item in the list. You can use the
    Stack class as a general guide.
