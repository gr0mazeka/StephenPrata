                         PROGRAMMING EXERCISES CHAPTER 5


1.  Write a program that requests the user to enter two integers. The program
    should then calculate and report the sum of all the integers between and
    including the two integers. At this point, assume that the smaller integer
    is entered first. For example, if the user enters 2 and 9, the program
    should report that the sum of all the integers from 2 through 9 is 44.

2.  Redo Listing 5.4 using a type array object instead of a built-in array and
    type long double instead of long long. Find the value of 100!

3.  Write a program that asks the user to type in numbers.After each entry, the
    program should report the cumulative sum of the entries to date. The program
    should terminate when the user enters 0.

4.  Daphne invests $100 at 10% simple interest. That is, every year, the
    investment earns 10% of the original investment, or $10 each and every year:

    interest = 0.10 × original balance
    
    At the same time, Cleo invests $100 at 5% compound interest. That is,
    interest is 5% of the current balance, including previous additions of
    interest:

    interest = 0.05 × current balance

    Cleo earns 5% of $100 the first year, giving her $105.The next year she
    earns 5% of $105, or $5.25, and so on.Write a program that finds how many
    years it takes for the value of Cleo’s investment to exceed the value of
    Daphne’s investment and then displays the value of both investments at that
    time.

5.  You sell the book C++ for Fools. Write a program that has you enter a year’s
    worth of monthly sales (in terms of number of books, not of money). The
    program should use a loop to prompt you by month, using an array of char *
    (or an array of string objects, if you prefer) initialized to the month 
    trings and storing the input data in an array of int. Then, the program
    should find the sum of the array contents and report the total sales for the
    year.

6.  Do Programming Exercise 5 but use a two-dimensional array to store input for
    3 years of monthly sales. Report the total sales for each individual year
    and for the combined years.

7.  Design a structure called car that holds the following information about an
    automobile: its make, as a string in a character array or in a string
    object, and the year it was built, as an integer.Write a program that asks
    the user how many cars to catalog. The program should then use new to create
    a dynamic array of that many car structures. Next, it should prompt the user
    to input the make (which might consist of more than one word) and year
    information for each structure. Note that this requires some care because it
    alternates reading strings with numeric data (see Chapter 4). Finally, it
    should display the contents of each structure. A sample run should look
    something like the following:

    How many cars do you wish to catalog? 2
    Car #1:
    Please enter the make: Hudson Hornet
    Please enter the year made: 1952
    Car #2:
    Please enter the make: Kaiser
    Please enter the year made: 1951
    Here is your collection:
    1952 Hudson Hornet
    1951 Kaiser

8.  Write a program that uses an array of char and a loop to read one word at a
    time until the word done is entered. The program should then report the
    number of words entered (not counting done). A sample run could look like
    this:

    Enter words (to stop, type the word done):
    anteater birthday category dumpster
    envy finagle geometry done for sure
    You entered a total of 7 words.
    
    You should include the cstring header file and use the strcmp() function to
    make the comparison test.

9.  Write a program that matches the description of the program in Programming
    Exercise 8, but use a string class object instead of an array. Include the
    string header file and use a relational operator to make the comparison
    test.

10. Write a program using nested loops that asks the user to enter a value for
    the number of rows to display. It should then display that many rows of
    asterisks, with one asterisk in the first row, two in the second row, and so
    on. For each row, the asterisks are preceded by the number of periods needed
    to make all the rows display a total number of characters equal to the
    number of rows. A sample run would look like this:
    
    Enter number of rows: 5
    ....*
    ...**
    ..***
    .****
    *****
