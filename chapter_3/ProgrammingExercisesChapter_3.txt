                         PROGRAMMING EXERCISES CHAPTER 3


1.  Write a short program that asks for your height in integer inches and then
    converts your height to feet and inches. Have the program use the underscore
    character to indicate where to type the response. Also use a const symbolic
    constant to represent the conversion factor.

2.  Write a short program that asks for your height in feet and inches and your
    weight in pounds. (Use three variables to store the information.) Have the
    program report your body mass index (BMI). To calculate the BMI, first
    convert your height in feet and inches to your height in inches
    (1 foot = 12 inches). Then convert your height in inches to your height in
    meters by multiplying by 0.0254. Then convert your weight in pounds into
    your mass in kilograms by dividing by 2.2. Finally, compute your BMI by
    dividing your mass in kilograms by the square of your height in meters. Use
    symbolic constants to represent the various conversion factors.

3.  Write a program that asks the user to enter a latitude in degrees, minutes,
    and seconds and that then displays the latitude in decimal format. There are
    60 seconds of arc to a minute and 60 minutes of arc to a degree; represent
    these values with symbolic constants. You should use a separate variable for
    each input value. A sample run should look like this:

    Enter a latitude in degrees, minutes, and seconds:
    First, enter the degrees: 37
    Next, enter the minutes of arc: 51
    Finally, enter the seconds of arc: 19
    37 degrees, 51 minutes, 19 seconds = 37.8553 degrees

4.  Write a program that asks the user to enter the number of seconds as an
    integer value (use type long, or, if available, long long) and that then
    displays the equivalent time in days, hours, minutes, and seconds. Use
    symbolic constants to represent the number of hours in the day, the number
    of minutes in an hour, and the number of seconds in a minute. The output
    should look like this:

    Enter the number of seconds: 31600000
    31600000 seconds = 365 days, 17 hours, 46 minutes, 40 seconds

5.  Write a program that requests the user to enter the current world population
    and the current population of the U.S. (or of some other nation of your
    choice). Store the information in variables of type long long. Have the
    program display the percent that the U.S. (or other nation’s) population is
    of the world’s population. The output should look something like this:

    Enter the world's population: 6898758899
    Enter the population of the US: 310783781
    The population of the US is 4.50492% of the world population.

    You can use the Internet to get more recent figures.

6.  Write a program that asks how many miles you have driven and how many
    gallons of gasoline you have used and then reports the miles per gallon your
    car has gotten. Or, if you prefer, the program can request distance in
    kilometers and petrol in liters and then report the result European style,
    in liters per 100 kilometers.

7.  Write a program that asks you to enter an automobile gasoline consumption
    figure in the European style (liters per 100 kilometers) and converts to the
    U.S. style of miles per gallon. Note that in addition to using different
    units of measurement, the U.S. approach (distance / fuel) is the inverse of
    the European approach (fuel / distance). Note that 100 kilometers is
    62.14 miles, and 1 gallon is 3.875 liters. Thus, 19 mpg is about
    12.4 l/100 km, and 27 mpg is about 8.7 l/100 km.
