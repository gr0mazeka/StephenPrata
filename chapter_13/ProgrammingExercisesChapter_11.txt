                         PROGRAMMING EXERCISES CHAPTER 13


1.  Start with the following class declaration:

    // base class
    class Cd { // represents a CD disk
    private:
        char performers[50];
        char label[20];
        int selections; // number of selections
        double playtime; // playing time in minutes
    public:
        Cd(char * s1, char * s2, int n, double x);
        Cd(const Cd & d);
        Cd();
        ~Cd();
        void Report() const; // reports all CD data
        Cd & operator=(const Cd & d);
    };

    Derive a Classic class that adds an array of char members that will hold a
    string identifying the primary work on the CD. If the base class requires
    that any functions be virtual,modify the base-class declaration to make it
    so. If a declared method is not needed,remove it from the definition. Test
    your product with the following program:

    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;
    #include "classic.h" // which will contain #include cd.h
    void Bravo(const Cd & disk);
    int main()
    {
        Cd c1("Beatles", "Capitol", 14, 35.5);
        Classic c2 = Classic("Piano Sonata in B flat, Fantasia in C",
        "Alfred Brendel", "Philips", 2, 57.17);
        Cd *pcd = &c1;
        cout << "Using object directly:\n";
        c1.Report(); // use Cd method
        c2.Report(); // use Classic method
        cout << "Using type cd * pointer to objects:\n";
        pcd->Report(); // use Cd method for cd object
        pcd = &c2;
        pcd->Report(); // use Classic method for classic object
        cout << "Calling a function with a Cd reference argument:\n";
        Bravo(c1);
        Bravo(c2);
        cout << "Testing assignment: ";
        Classic copy;
        copy = c2;
        copy.Report()
        return 0;
    }
    void Bravo(const Cd & disk)
    {
        disk.Report();
    }

2.  Do Programming Exercise 1 but use dynamic memory allocation instead of
    fixed size arrays for the various strings tracked by the two classes.

3.  Revise the baseDMA - lacksDMA - hasDMA class hierarchy so that all three
    classes are derived from an ABC. Test the result with a program similar to
    the one in Listing 13.10. That is, it should feature an array of pointers to
    the ABC and allow the user to make runtime decisions as to what types of
    objects are created. Add virtual View() methods to the class definitions to
    handle displaying the data.

4.  The Benevolent Order of Programmers maintains a collection of bottled port.
    To describe it,the BOP Portmaster has devised a Port class,as declared here:

    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;
    class Port
    {
    private:
        char * brand;
        char style[20]; // i.e., tawny, ruby, vintage
        int bottles;
    public:
        Port(const char * br = "none", const char * st = "none", int b = 0);
        Port(const Port & p); // copy constructor
        virtual ~Port() { delete [] brand;  }
        Port & operator=(const Port & p);
        Port & operator+=(int b); // adds b to bottles
        Port & operator-=(int b); // subtracts b from bottles, if available
        int BottleCount() const { return bottles;  }
        virtual void Show() const;
        friend ostream & operator<<(ostream & os, const Port & p);
    };

    The Show() method presents information in the following format:

    Brand: Gallo
    Kind: tawny
    Bottles: 20

    The operator<<() function presents information in the following format (with
    no newline character at the end):

    Gallo, tawny, 20

    The Portmaster completed the method definitions for the Port class and then
    derived the VintagePort class as follows before being relieved of his
    position for accidentally routing a bottle of ’45 Cockburn to someone
    preparing an experimental barbecue sauce:

    class VintagePort : public Port // style necessarily = "vintage"
    {
    private:
        char * nickname; // i.e., "The Noble" or "Old Velvet", etc.
        int year; // vintage year
    public:
        VintagePort();
        VintagePort(const char * br, int b, const char * nn, int y);
        VintagePort(const VintagePort & vp);
        ~VintagePort() { delete [] nickname;  }
        VintagePort & operator=(const VintagePort & vp);
        void Show() const;
        friend ostream & operator<<(ostream & os, const VintagePort & vp);
    };

    You get the job of completing the VintagePort work.

    a.  Your first task is to re-create the Port method definitions because the
        former Portmaster immolated his upon being relieved.
    b.  Your second task is to explain why certain methods are redefined and
        others are not.
    c.  Your third task is to explain why operator=() and operator<<() are not
        virtual.
    d.  Your fourth task is to provide definitions for the VintagePort methods.
