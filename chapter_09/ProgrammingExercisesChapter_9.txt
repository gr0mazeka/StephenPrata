                         PROGRAMMING EXERCISES CHAPTER 9


1.  Here is a header file:

    // golf.h -- for pe9-1.cpp

    const int Len = 40;
    struct golf
    {
        char fullname[Len];
        int handicap;
    };

    // non-interactive version:
    // function sets golf structure to provided name, handicap
    // using values passed as arguments to the function
    void setgolf(golf & g, const char * name, int hc);

    // interactive version:
    // function solicits name and handicap from user
    // and sets the members of g to the values entered
    // returns 1 if name is entered, 0 if name is empty string
    int setgolf(golf & g);

    // function resets handicap to new value
    void handicap(golf & g, int hc);

    // function displays contents of golf structure
    void showgolf(const golf & g);

    Note that setgolf() is overloaded. Using the first version of setgolf()
    would look like this:

    golf ann;
    setgolf(ann, "Ann Birdfree", 24);

    The function call provides the information that’s stored in the ann
    structure. Using the second version of setgolf() would look like this:

    golf andy;
    setgolf(andy);

    The function would prompt the user to enter the name and handicap and store
    them in the andy structure.This function could (but doesn’t need to) use the
    first version internally.

    Put together a multifile program based on this header. One file, named
    golf.cpp, should provide suitable function definitions to match the
    prototypes in the header file. A second file should contain main() and
    demonstrate all the features of the prototyped functions. For example, a
    loop should solicit input for an array of golf structures and terminate when
    the array is full or the user enters an empty string for the golfer’s name.
    The main() function should use only the prototyped functions to access the
    golf structures.

2.  Redo Listing 9.9, replacing the character array with a string object. The
    program should no longer have to check whether the input string fits, and it
    can compare the input string to "" to check for an empty line.

3.  Begin with the following structure declaration:

    struct chaff
    {
        char dross[20];
        int slag;
    };

    Write a program that uses placement new to place an array of two such
    structures in a buffer. Then assign values to the structure members
    (remembering to use strcpy() for the char array) and use a loop to display
    the contents. Option 1 is to use a static array, like that in Listing 9.10,
    for the buffer. Option 2 is to use regular new to allocate the buffer.

4.  Write a three-file program based on the following namespace:

    namespace SALES
    {
        const int QUARTERS = 4;
        struct Sales
        {
            double sales[QUARTERS];
            double average;
            double max;
            double min;
        };
        // copies the lesser of 4 or n items from the array ar
        // to the sales member of s and computes and stores the
        // average, maximum, and minimum values of the entered items;
        // remaining elements of sales, if any, set to 0
        void setSales(Sales & s, const double ar[], int n);
        // gathers sales for 4 quarters interactively, stores them
        // in the sales member of s and computes and stores the
        // average, maximum, and minimum values
        void setSales(Sales & s);
        // display all information in structure s
        void showSales(const Sales & s);
    }

    The first file should be a header file that contains the namespace. The
    second file should be a source code file that extends the namespace to
    provide definitions for the three prototyped functions. The third file
    should declare two Sales objects. It should use the interactive version of
    setSales() to provide values for one structure and the non-interactive
    version of setSales() to provide values for the second structure. It should
    display the contents of both structures by using showSales().
