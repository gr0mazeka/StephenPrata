                         PROGRAMMING EXERCISES CHAPTER 7


1.  Write a program that repeatedly asks the user to enter pairs of numbers
    until at least one of the pair is 0. For each pair, the program should use a
    function to calculate the harmonic mean of the numbers. The function should
    return the answer to main(), which should report the result. The harmonic
    mean of the numbers is the inverse of the average of the inverses and can be
    calculated as follows:

    harmonic mean = 2.0 × x × y / (x + y)

2.  Write a program that asks the user to enter up to 10 golf scores, which are
    to be stored in an array. You should provide a means for the user to
    terminate input prior to entering 10 scores. The program should display all
    the scores on one line and report the average score. Handle input, display,
    and the average calculation with three separate array-processing functions.

3.  Here is a structure declaration:

    struct box
    {
        char maker[40];
        float height;
        float width;
        float length;
        float volume;
    };

    a.  Write a function that passes a box structure by value and that displays
        the value of each member.
    b.  Write a function that passes the address of a box structure and that
        sets the volume member to the product of the other three dimensions.
    c.  Write a simple program that uses these two functions.

4.  Many state lotteries use a variation of the simple lottery portrayed by
    Listing 7.4. In these variations you choose several numbers from one set and
    call them the field numbers. For example, you might select five numbers from
    the field of 1–47). You also pick a single number (called a mega number or a
    power ball, etc.) from a second range, such as 1–27. To win the grand prize,
    you have to guess all the picks correctly. The chance of winning is the
    product of the probability of picking all the field numbers times the
    probability of picking the mega number. For instance, the probability of
    winning the example described here is the product of the probability of
    picking 5 out of 47 correctly times the probability of picking 1 out of 27
    correctly. Modify Listing 7.4 to calculate the probability of winning this
    kind of lottery.

5.  Define a recursive function that takes an integer argument and returns the
    factorial of that argument. Recall that 3 factorial, written 3!, equals
    3 × 2!, and so on, with 0! defined as 1. In general, if n is greater than
    zero, n! = n * (n - 1)!. Test your function in a program that uses a loop to
    allow the user to enter various values for which the program reports the
    factorial.

6.  Write a program that uses the following functions:

    Fill_array() takes as arguments the name of an array of double values and an
    array size. It prompts the user to enter double values to be entered in the
    array. It ceases taking input when the array is full or when the user enters
    non-numeric input, and it returns the actual number of entries.

    Show_array() takes as arguments the name of an array of double values and an
    array size and displays the contents of the array.

    Reverse_array() takes as arguments the name of an array of double values and
    an array size and reverses the order of the values stored in the array.

    The program should use these functions to fill an array, show the array,
    reverse the array, show the array, reverse all but the first and last
    elements of the array, and then show the array.

7.  Redo Listing 7.7, modifying the three array-handling functions to each use
    two pointer parameters to represent a range.The fill_array() function,
    instead of returning the actual number of items read, should return a
    pointer to the location after the last location filled; the other functions
    can use this pointer as the second argument to identify the end of the data.

8.  Redo Listing 7.15 without using the array class. Do two versions:

    a.  Use an ordinary array of const char * for the strings representing the
        season names, and use an ordinary array of double for the expenses.

    b.  Use an ordinary array of const char * for the strings representing the
        season names, and use a structure whose sole member is an ordinary array
        of double for the expenses. (This design is similar to the basic design
        of the array class.)

9.  This exercise provides practice in writing functions dealing with arrays and
    structures. The following is a program skeleton. Complete it by providing
    the described functions:

    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;
    const int SLEN = 30;
    struct student {
        char fullname[SLEN];
        char hobby[SLEN];
        int ooplevel;
    };
    // getinfo() has two arguments: a pointer to the first element of
    // an array of student structures and an int representing the
    // number of elements of the array. The function solicits and
    // stores data about students. It terminates input upon filling
    // the array or upon encountering a blank line for the student
    // name. The function returns the actual number of array elements
    // filled.
    int getinfo(student pa[], int n);
    // display1() takes a student structure as an argument
    // and displays its contents
    void display1(student st);
    // display2() takes the address of student structure as an
    // argument and displays the structure’s contents
    void display2(const student * ps);
    // display3() takes the address of the first element of an array
    // of student structures and the number of array elements as
    // arguments and displays the contents of the structures
    void display3(const student pa[], int n);
    int main()
    {
        cout << “Enter class size: “;
        int class_size;
        cin >> class_size;
        while (cin.get() != '\n’)
            continue;
        student * ptr_stu = new student[class_size];
        int entered = getinfo(ptr_stu, class_size);
        for (int i = 0; i < entered; i++)
        {
            display1(ptr_stu[i]);
            display2(&ptr_stu[i]);
        }
        display3(ptr_stu, entered);
        delete [] ptr_stu;
        cout << “Done\n”;
        return 0;
    }

10. Design a function calculate() that takes two type double values and a
    pointer to a function that takes two double arguments and returns a double.
    The calculate() function should also be type double, and it should return
    the value that the pointed-to function calculates, using the double
    arguments to calculate(). For example, suppose you have this definition for
    the add()function:

    double add(double x, double y)
    {
        return x + y;
    }

    Then, the function call in the following would cause calculate() to pass the
    values 2.5 and 10.4 to the add() function and then return the add() return
    value (12.9):

    double q = calculate(2.5, 10.4, add);

    Use these functions and at least one additional function in the add() mold
    in a program.The program should use a loop that allows the user to enter
    pairs of numbers. For each pair, use calculate() to invoke add() and at
    least one other function. If you are feeling adventurous, try creating an
    array of pointers to add()-style functions and use a loop to successively
    apply calculate() to a series of functions by using these pointers. Hint:
    Here’s how to declare such an array of three pointers:

    double (*pf[3])(double, double);

    You can initialize such an array by using the usual array initialization
    syntax and function names as addresses.')
